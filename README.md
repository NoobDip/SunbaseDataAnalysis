# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains code for a customer churn prediction project. The project aims to predict customer churn using a dataset and apply various data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques. The project includes code to clean the data, visualize important insights, and train machine learning models for prediction.

## Files
- `customer_churn_large_dataset.xlsx`: The dataset used for the project.
- `Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for data preprocessing, visualization, and model training.
- `Churn_Rate_by_Location.png`: Image of the churn rate by location visualization.
- `Usage_by_Location.png`: Image of the usage rate by location visualization.
- `Distribution_of_Average_Monthly_Usage.png`: Image of the distribution of average monthly usage before filtering outliers.
- `Adjusted_Distribution_of_Average_Monthly_Usage.png`: Image of the distribution of average monthly usage after filtering outliers.
- `Distribution_of_Average_Bill_Per_GB.png`: Image of the distribution of average bill per GB before filtering outliers.
- `Adjusted_Distribution_of_Average_Bill_Per_GB.png`: Image of the distribution of average bill per GB after filtering outliers.
- `heatmap.png`: Image of the correlation heatmap.
- `final_heatmap.png`: Image of the final correlation heatmap.
- `Report.pdf`: Report summarising the process.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can use the following command:
   > pip install pandas matplotlib numpy seaborn scikit-learn
3. Open the `Analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to explore the code and visualizations.
4. Run the code cells in the notebook to execute the data preprocessing, visualization, and model training steps.
5. The notebook doesn't include code to save the visualizations as images. The images are saved in the 'Visualisations' folder.
6. You can upload the code, dataset, and images to your GitHub repository for version control and sharing with others.
